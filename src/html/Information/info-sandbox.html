    This sandbox is for testing working theses related to responsive typography in web browsers such as Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer. To ensure consistency across user preferences for font size, it is recommended to use responsive measurements such as rem, em, and ch. However, on mobile platforms, browsers may not have the same text size settings, and rely more on zooming. The following are some regular components and unit settings to switch between. Additionally, some spelling errors have been corrected.
